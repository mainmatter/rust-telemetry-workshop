# What to log

We have talked extensively about the mechanics of logging (how to log, how to implement a logger,
how to filter), but we haven't really talked about **what** to log.

## Why do we log?

To determine what to log, we need to stop for a second and think about the **purpose** of logging.
We use logging as a way to determine, **from the outside**, what is going on **inside** our
applications. In particular, as a way to diagnose if our applications are not behaving as
expected.

The "easy" solution would be to log **everything**, a full-fidelity representation of the
internal state of our applications.\  
Unfortunately, that's usually not feasible: the cost of producing and storing that information
would be prohibitive.

Logs, therefore, are necessarily a **lossy** representation.
We need to **choose carefully** what to log in order to maximize our chances of
*spotting** problems and being able to **troubleshoot** them.

## Unit of work

A good rule of thumb is to view your application logic as a series of **units of work**.  
Each unit of work has a start and an end, and may in turn contain other sub-units of work.

For each of those unit of work, we'll surely want to know:

- how long it took to complete, i.e. its **duration**
- whether it completed successfully or not, i.e. its **outcome**

We'll get both of these pieces of information if we emit two log records for each unit of work:
one at the start and one at the end.

### How fine-grained should the units of work be?

If you take this approach to the extreme, you could model each function call as a unit of work.
While that _may_ be useful in some scenarios, it's not a good default.  

You should consider a unit of work as a **meaningful** piece of work, one that may
occupy a **significant** amount of time with respect to the duration of the over-arching
operation (e.g. processing an incoming request).

Let's make an example in the context of a web server.\
Parsing a header value is probably not a good candidate for a unit of workâ€”it's very fast and
it's unlikely to vary much in duration.
On the contrary, parsing the body of a request is a good candidate: it's likely to take a
significant amount of time, and it's likely to vary in duration depending on the size of the
body itself and the way it is being sent to the server.

Always take the over-arching context into account when determining what should or should not
be treated as a unit of work.
