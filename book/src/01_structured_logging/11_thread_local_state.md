# Thread local state

How does `tracing` know which span is currently active?

That's necessary to implement a few of the features we've seen so far:

- `Span::current()`, which returns a handle over that span that is currently active
- Attaching a new span as a child of the currently active span

The answer is **thread local state**.

## `thread_local!`

Rust's standard library exposes a `thread_local!` macro that allows you to define a variable
that is local to the current thread.  
It's a bit like `static`, but it's not shared across threads.

It comes with a caveat: if you move to a different thread, you won't be able to access the
value you set on the previous thread.

## Spawning threads breaks the hierarchy

`tracing` uses thread local state to keep track of the currently active span.  
This has an interesting implication: if you spawn a thread to do some work, the spans
created in that thread will **not** be linked to the spans created in the parent thread.

```rust
use tracing::{info_span, info};

let spawner_span = info_span!("spawner");
let _guard = spawner_span.enter();

std::thread::spawn(|| {
    // This is NOT a child of `spawner_span`!
    let spawned_span = info_span!("spawned");
    // [...]
});
```

This is something to be aware of when you're using `tracing` in a multithreaded environment.
You have three options:

- Leave the spans unlinked. This is OK if the two unit of works are actually unrelated.
- Explicitly mark the `spawned` span as a child of the `spawner` span. This is desirable
  if the `spawner` span won't be closed until the `spawned` span is closed (e.g. if you are
  waiting for the new thread to finish).
- Explicitly mark the `spawned` span as a "follower" of the `spawner` span. This maintains a
  connection between the two spans, but it doesn't require the `spawner` span to be kept open.
  This works pretty well when spawning background tasks that might complete after the `spawner`
  unit of work is done.
