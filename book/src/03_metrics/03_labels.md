# Labels

Not all metric samples are equal.
You start tracking the number of requests received by your API. But knowing
that number on its own is not enough: your API offers multiple endpoints, where is that
traffic actually going?

You could solve the issue by using a separate metric for each endpoint.
It would work!
But it'd make it more difficult to manipulate those metrics in your tool of choice:
it's much easier to look for a standard "request_count_total" than
a bespoke "request_subscribe_count_total". You might also want to visualize them all
in a single dashboard, using a separate colour for each endpoint: having to add each
endpoint manually would be tedious.

The metric world came up with a solution: when you want to capture a certain dimension,
but be able to break it down further, you add **labels**.

Labels are a set of key-value pairs that you specify when interacting with a metric.
Under the hood, it behaves exactly as having separate metric series: recorders will track each
combination of (metric name, [(label keys, label value)]) as its own unique metric.  
But we retain the semantic understanding that they are all "subsets" of an overall measurement.

# Cardinality

Be **extremely** careful with labels!  
You should only rely on labels for tracking dimensions that have a well-known and **bounded**
cardinality (the set of possible values)â€”e.g. you don't want to add "user_id" as a label on
your metrics!  
Each unique label value creates its own metric series, significantly increasing the amount of
memory and work necessary to keep track of those metrics in your application.  

The number of metric series you are effectively creating/storing/exporting scales as the
**product** of the cardinality of each label:

```text
# metrics series = { # unique values for label 1 } x .. x { # unique values for label N }
```

That grows fast.
If you don't keep an eye on label cardinality you're likely to blow up whatever tool you are
exporting metric data to.
If it doesn't fail over, you can expect to be punished at the end of the next billing cycle.

You've been warned!
