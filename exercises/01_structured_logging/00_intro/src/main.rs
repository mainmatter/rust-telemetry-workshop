//! # Logs
//!
//! We will start our observability journey with logs.
//!
//! Logs are the most common kind of telemetry data.
//! Even developers who have never heard of observability have an intuitive understanding of
//! the usefulness of logs: logs are what you look at when stuff goes south to understand what is
//! happening, crossing your fingers extra hard hoping you captured enough information to
//! troubleshoot effectively.
//!
//! What are logs though?
//! The format varies, depending on the epoch, the platform and the technologies you are using.
//! The simplest starting point: a bunch of text pushed to `stdout`, with a line break to separate
//! the current record from the next one. For example:
//!
//! ```text
//! The application is starting on port 8080
//! Handling a request to /index
//! Returned a 200 OK
//! ```
//!
//! Three perfectly-valid log records for a web server.
//! Enough to understand, from the outside, what is happening.

/// # Exercise
///
/// The standard library contains the most basic logging framework you can think of: [`println!`].
/// Add `println!` statements to the little CLI below as required to get the tests to pass.
