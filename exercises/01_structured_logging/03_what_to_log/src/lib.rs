//! # What to log
//!
//! We have talked extensively about the mechanics of logging (how to log, how to implement a logger,
//! how to filter), but we haven't really talked about **what** to log.
//!
//! ## Why do we log?
//!
//! To determine what to log, we need to stop for a second and think about the **purpose** of logging.
//! We use logging as a way to determine, **from the outside**, what is going on **inside** our
//! applications. In particular, as a way to diagnose if our applications are not behaving as
//! expected.
//!
//! The "easy" solution would be to log **everything**, a full-fidelity representation of the
//! internal state of our applications.  
//! Unfortunately, that's usually not feasible: the cost of producing and storing that information
//! would be prohibitive.
//!
//! Logs, therefore, are necessarily a **lossy** representation.
//! We need to **choose carefully** what to log in order to maximize our chances of
//! *spotting** problems and being able to **troubleshoot** them.
//!
//! ## Unit of work
//!
//! A good rule of thumb is to view your application logic as a series of **units of work**.  
//! Each unit of work has a start and an end, and may in turn contain other sub-units of work.
//!
//! For each of those unit of work, we'll surely want to know:
//! - how long it took to complete, i.e. its **duration**
//! - whether it completed successfully or not, i.e. its **outcome**
//!
//! We'll get both of these pieces of information if we emit two log records for each unit of work:
//! one at the start and one at the end.
//!
//! ### How fine-grained should the units of work be?
//!
//! If you take this approach to the extreme, you could model each function call as a unit of work.
//! While that _may_ be useful in some scenarios, it's not a good default.  
//!
//! You should consider a unit of work as a **meaningful** piece of work, one that may
//! occupy a **significant** amount of time with respect to the duration of the over-arching
//! operation (e.g. processing an incoming request).
//!
//! Let's make an example in the context of a web server.
//! Parsing a header value is probably not a good candidate for a unit of workâ€”it's very fast and
//! it's unlikely to vary much in duration.
//! On the contrary, parsing the body of a request is a good candidate: it's likely to take a
//! significant amount of time, and it's likely to vary in duration depending on the size of the
//! body itself and the way it is being sent to the server.
//!
//! Always take the over-arching context into account when determining what should or should not
//! be treated as a unit of work.
