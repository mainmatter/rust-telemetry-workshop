//! # The `tracing` crate
//!
//! ## `log` is not the right abstraction
//!
//! In the previous exercise, we laid out the key abstraction we need to model our applications:
//! **units of work**.  
//! We've also tried to leverage the `log` crate to properly track them, but you may have noticed
//! that it's not a perfect fit.  
//!
//! The `log` crate is structured around the concept of **log events**.  
//! There is no duration. There is also no **relationship** between one event and the other,
//! while we have seen how our units of work are naturally organised in a **hierarchical** fashionâ€”
//! a unit of work may in turn contain multiple sub-units of work, and so on.
//!
//! We need to change our instrumentation library to one that is more suited to our needs: the
//! `tracing` crate.
//!
//! ## `tracing::Span`
//!
//! The `tracing` crate models units of work as **spans**.  
//! A span is a unit of work that has a **start** and an **end**.
//! A span can also have a parent, which naturally introduces that hierarchical relationship we
//! were looking for.
//!
//! The richer data model translates into a more complex interface, both on the instrumentation
//! side (i.e. the code that emits spans) and on the consumer side (i.e. the code that processes
//! spans).  
//! This is one of the reasons I chose to talk about `log` first: it's a gentler introduction
//! to the overall facade pattern and by probing its limitations you (hopefully) have a better
//! understanding of the rationale behind `tracing`'s additional complexity.
//!
//! # Exercise
//!
//! We'll ignore the consumer side for now and focus on the instrumentation side.  
//! We'll redo the previous exercise using the `tracing` crate in order to get familiar with the
//! basics.
