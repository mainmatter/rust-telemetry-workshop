//! # `tracing` subscribers
//!
//! So far we've focused on the instrumentation side of `tracing`—spans, fields, etc.
//! But we haven't talked about how to **consume** the data we're producing.
//!
//! # `Subscriber`
//!
//! To see `tracing` in action we've already had to play with different processors:
//! interpolated text to the console, JSON, and OpenTelemetry.  
//!
//! They are all examples of `tracing` **subscribers**—i.e. implementors of the
//! [`Subscriber`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/subscriber/trait.Subscriber.html)
//! trait.  
//!
//! A subscriber is **much more complex** than what we have previously seen in this workshop,
//! the `Record` trait from the `log` crate.  
//! `tracing` offers a richer data model, therefore pushing more responsibilities to the subscriber.
//! For example: each span has to be assigned a unique ID, which is used to link spans together in a
//! hierarchical structure.  
//! Complexity is further compounded by the fact that `tracing` is designed to be extremely
//! low-overhead, to maximise its applicability in production environments.
//!
//! ## `Registry`
//!
//! It's rare to find yourself implementing the `Subscriber` trait from scratch.  
//! More often than not, you'll rely on [`Registry`](https://docs.rs/tracing_subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/registry/struct.Registry.html)
//! as your foundation.  
//! It takes care of all the complicated bits (e.g. span ID generation and management) and
//! exposes a simple(r) interface for you to implement: the
//! [`Layer`](https://docs.rs/tracing_subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/layer/trait.Layer.html) trait.
//!
//! ## `Layer`
//!
//! Even better: you don't even have to implement `Layer` yourself (unless you want to).  
//! You can **combine** multiple layers together using the `with` method exposed by
//! the `SubscriberExt` trait.  
//! You just stack multiple layers from the ecosystem on top of each other,
//! downstream of a `Registry`, and you're good to go.
//!
//! # Exercise
//!
//! Build a `tracing` subscriber that:
//!
//! - Emits JSON-structured logs to an in-memory buffer
//! - Exports telemetry data in OpenTelemetry format to Honeycomb
//! - Only captures spans that are level `INFO` or above
//!
//! You can look at the subscribers we built in the previous exercises for inspiration!
