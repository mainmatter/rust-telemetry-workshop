//! # Instrumenting asynchronous code
//!
//! We're finally ready to tackle the big boss: instrumenting asynchronous code.
//!
//! Let's start by brushing up on Rust's asynchronous programming model. If you're familiar
//! with the details, feel free to skim through!
//!
//! ## `Future`s
//!
//! The cornerstone of Rust's asynchronous programming model is the `Future` trait.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! pub trait Future {
//!     type Output;
//!
//!     // Required method
//!     fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! We refer to an implementor of the `Future` trait as a future.
//! A future represents a computation that will **eventually** produce a value (of type `Output`).
//! Futures are designed to be lazyâ€”if you want them to make progress on whatever job they're
//! doing, you need to repeatedly call their `poll` method until they're done, i.e. `Poll::Ready`
//! is returned.
//!
//! ## Async runtimes
//!
//! The component in charge of polling a future is known as an **asynchronous runtime**.
//! Rust's standard library does not include a "default" asynchronous runtime. You need to bring
//! your own, usually as a third-party dependency.
//!
//! When it comes to `tracing`, there are two key things to keep in mind when it comes to
//! asynchronous runtimes:
//!
//! - When a certain future can't make any more progress (i.e. it returns `Poll::Pending`) the
//!   runtime will usually try to run (on that very thread!) another future that has been queued up.
//!   This is what allows concurrency to be highly efficient!
//! - Many popular runtimes (e.g. `tokio` or `async-std`) are built around the concept of
//!   multi-threaded **work-stealing**. The next time a future is polled, it may be
//!   **on a different thread**.
//!   This model comes with some advantages: you don't need to worry too much about balancing your
//!   work across threads, the runtime will transparently take care of it for you.  
//!   It also introduces some challenges: you can't rely on thread-local state to keep track of
//!   values that the future cares about, because the next it's polled it may be on a different
//!   thread where that state is not available (or it's set to a different value).
//!
//! # `Instrumented`
//!
//! As much as possible, we want our instrumentation code to behave correctly no matter what runtime
//! our code is being executed on.  
//! Let's assume that a future is a unit of work we want to track. We want to know how much time
//! it is spent doing work (i.e. inside `poll`), as well as how long it takes in terms of wall
//! clock time.  
//! Based on what we discussed so far, it follows that:
//!
//! - Any `tracing`-specific state that is associated to our future (i.e. its span handle)
//!   must be stored in the future itself.
//! - Whenever our future is polled, we need to re-enter its span.
//! - Whenever our future returns from `poll`, we need to exit its span.
//!
//! This is the exact strategy implemented in the `tracing` crate via the `Instrumented` future:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // I have spared you the Pin-related stuff here, for simplicity.
//! // You can see the full implementation with all the details in `tracing`'s source code.
//! pub struct Instrumented<T> {
//!     inner: T,
//!     span: Span,
//! }
//!
//! impl<T: Future> Future for Instrumented<T> {
//!     type Output = T::Output;
//!
//!     fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
//!         let _enter = self.span.enter();
//!         self.inner.poll(cx)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It wraps around the future you want to instrument and bundles it together with its tracking span.
//! Every time `poll` is called, we enter the span and then exit it when it returns.
//! One of those cases where the actual implementation is very simple compared to the rationale
//! that justifies it!

    // `.await` points is where the runtime gets back into the driving sit
