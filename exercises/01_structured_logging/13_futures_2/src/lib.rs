//! # Instrumenting asynchronous code - Part 2
//!
//! `Instrumented` is neat, but ergonomics are a bit poor: in order to attach a span to an
//! invocation of an async function we need to write a bunch of wrapping glue code.
//!
//! Wrapping glue code... we've complained about it before, haven't we?
//! Yes! When attaching a span to a synchronous function invocation.
//!
//! `#[tracing::instrument]` is here to rescue us, **again**!
//! The macro is smart enough to detect that the function it is applied to is asynchronous:
//! it will automatically generate the required glue code and attach the span using `.instrument`.
