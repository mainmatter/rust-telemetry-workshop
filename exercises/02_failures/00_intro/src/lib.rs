//! # Error handling
//!
//! When monitoring a system, we are primarily interested in failures.
//! We want to know when something goes wrong, and we want to know why.
//!
//! This section of the workshop focuses on failuresâ€”in particular, how to capture their
//! occurrence in our telemetry data.
//!
//! Enjoy!
