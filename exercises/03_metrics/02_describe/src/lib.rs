//! # Describe
//!
//! Let's break down what happened in the last exercise.
//! You created a counter: a **monotonically increasing** value.  
//! Once it has been created, its value can only be incremented.
//!
//! You can create a counter with three different macros:
//!
//! - `increment_counter!`
//! - `counter!`
//! - `absolute_counter!`
//!
//! `increment_counter!` instructs the recorder to add 1 to the current counter value.
//!
//! `counter!`, instead, lets you specify a custom incrementâ€”e.g. `counter!("invocations", 2)`
//! will increase the counter value by 2.
//!
//! `absolute_counter!` is a bit special: it's primarily meant to initialize a counter sequence,
//! specifying a non-zero initial value. Beware: recorders will enforce the monotonicity property
//! for counters, so you can't rely on `absolute_counter!` to artificially decrement an existing
//! counter.
//!
//! In all three cases, the `Recorder` implementation is expected to:
//!
//! - Create a new counter with the name you specified, if one doesn't exist;
//! - Retrieve and update the counter, if one exists.
//!
//! `UPSERT` behaviour, for the SQL-minded among us.
//!
//! # Metadata
//!
//! It can be useful to add metadata to your counters (and metrics in general).  
//! You can rely on the `describe_*` macros offered by the `metrics!` crate: they let you add
//! a unit (e.g. capture that the counter value represents bytes or seconds) and a description
//! (which recorders can then choose to expose when metrics are exported/analyzes).

/// There is no need to describe the same metric series multiple times.
///
/// You can either perform this task in some kind of "initialization" phase for your application,
/// or rely on something like `Once`.
/// Deduping "manually" is usually cheaper than delegating the dedup work to the recorder, since it
/// might have to perform more processing before realising that there is nothing to be done (e.g.
/// manipulate the metric name, acquire a lock over the entire metric store, etc.).
