//! # Gauges
//!
//! We have seen the end-to-end journey of a metric series. It's time to take a step back
//! and expand our toolset beyond counters.
//!
//! We'll start with gauges.
//! Counters are expected to be positive and monotonically increasing: that's not the case for
//! gauges.
//! Gauges are designed to represent the current value of some property of interestâ€”the number of
//! concurrent requests being handled by your API, the number of idle connections in your
//! database connection pool or the available disk space on your server.
//! The value can increase or decrease over time, therefore counters are ill-suited for these
//! kinds of measurements.
//!
//! The value of a gauge is expected to be a float, rather than an integer.
//! Apart from that, everything else we learned about counters applies to gauges as well
//! (description, units, labels).
